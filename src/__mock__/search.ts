        "India, That Is Bharat, the first book of a comprehensive trilogy, explores the influence of European 'colonial consciousness' (or 'coloniality'), in particular its religious and racial roots, on Bharat as the successor state to the Indic civilisation and the origins of the Indian Constitution. It lays the foundation for its sequels by covering the period between the Age of Discovery, marked by Christopher Columbus' expedition in 1492, and the reshaping of Bharat through a British-made constitution-the Government of India Act of 1919. This includes international developments leading to the founding of the League of Nations by Western powers that tangibly impacted this journey. Further, this work also traces the origins of seemingly universal constructs such as 'toleration', 'secularism' and 'humanism' to Christian political theology. Their subsequent role in subverting the indigenous Indic consciousness through a secularised and universalised Reformation, that is, constitutionalism, is examined. It also puts forth the concept of Middle Eastern coloniality, which preceded its European variant and allies with it in the context of Bharat to advance their shared antipathy towards the Indic worldview. In order to liberate Bharat's distinctive indigeneity, 'decoloniality' is presented as a civilisational imperative in the spheres of nature, religion, culture, history, education, language and, crucially, in the realm of constitutionalism.",

        "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.... These immortal lines of Charles Dickens perhaps aptly describe everything Yuva Bharat reflects. In an uncanny reflection of the times we are living in while this book is being released, it talks about what the world needs to read right now. For these are the times of COVID-19. These are the times when 'normal' has been redefined. Author Devir traces the journey of 69 young men and women who defined their own 'new normal'. He talks about people whose worlds collapsed way before COVID-19 had hit us and who emerged victorious against undefinable odds-people of sheer grit who did not need legs to win races; people who vested their faith in the unseen; or people who rose from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix. Some of the remarkable stories include the struggles, learnings and indomitable passions of Rajkummar Rao, Kiren Rijiju, Aditi Rao Hydari, Remo D'souza, Abhinav Bindra and Chitrangada Singh, among many others, who each went on to excel in their own craft. Yuva Bharat encompasses these tales of overcoming all odds and achieving success eventually. A compelling narrative, it takes us through life journeys and inspires us to get up in this instant and take charge of our lives. A straight shot of adrenaline, Devir gives us our carpe diem moment!",

      publishedDate: "2019-05-25",
      description:
        "The rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was much more than an ordinary electoral phenomenon: it brought to the fore two contrasting views of nationhood: between those who saw modern India in terms of secular republicanism and on the other hand were those who sought to blend technological modernity with the country's Hindu inheritance. The Right's ascendancy and the debates that accompanied it, anticipated many of the concerns that find reflection today in the United States and Europe. The phenomenon of Hindu nationalism was also a profound intellectual challenge to the loose Left-liberal consensus that had prevailed in India since Jawaharlal Nehru became Prime Minister in 1947. The idea of Hindutva and the political character of the BJP have been closely scrutinised by scholars, and the impulse has been to view India's Right-wing politics as either a variant of fascism or merely a collection of sectarian prejudices. In fact, the inspiration for the Right in India has come from multiple and often contradictory sources, including the influence of individuals such as Sarvarkar, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo, not to mention the Arya Samaj movement. This collection is an attempt to showcase the phenomenon of Hindu nationalism in terms of how it perceives itself. Many of the concerns that drive the Indian Right are located in the country's nationalist culture. In trying to locate some of the ideas, attitudes and beliefs that define the Indian Right, Awakening Bharat Mata also seeks to identify the nature of Indian conservatism and identify its similarities and differences with political thought in the West. This book is not about Hindu nationalism in power but as a social and political movement and its aim is to encourage a more informed understanding of an idea that will remain relevant in Indian life far beyond victories and defeats in elections.",

        "Most literature related to start-ups lack an Indian context. Many young entrepreneurs are enticed by global success stories but are not aware of the numerous examples closer home. Innovate India showcases many such glowing examples from the country. From a Singapore-based scientist of Indian-origin to a next-door middle-class young person, these are the stories of Indian dreams turning into reality. Author Praveen Tiwari explains the key learning from these examples and lays out the path for young entrepreneurs that starts with registration with the Startup Scheme India to attract massive foreign trade. He further discusses a few start-ups that have established new milestones in social entrepreneurship and worked to organise India's huge unorganised sector. From empowering villagers through sanitary pads to providing them cheap electricity, from offering solutions to water crisis to securing data through block-chain technology, there's a lot to learn from these sagas. Innovate India gives details of the opportunities in some of the country's biggest sectors, such as agriculture and textiles. It also highlights how doing business was part of core Indian ethos and reveals some of the ancient trades and tribes involved in these. A work of rigorous research and hundreds of expert interviews, this is a must-read for all aspiring entrepreneurs.",

      title: "Who Is Bharat Mata? On History, Culture and the Idea of India",
      subtitle: "Writings by and on Jawaharlal Nehru",
      authors: ["Purushottam Agrawal"],
      publishedDate: "2019-06-10",
      description:
        "An unprecedented and timely collection of writings by and on Jawaharlal Nehru--the man who shaped newly independent India; and the icon whose legacy is the subject of intense and often angry debate today. 'Who is this Bharat Mata, whose victory you wish?' asked Jawaharlal Nehru--a leading light of the Indian freedom movement who would become the country's first prime minister--at a public gathering in 1936. And then he explained: the mountains and rivers, forests and fields were of course dear to everyone, but what counted ultimately were 'the people of India...spread out all over this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, [is] essentially these millions of people, and victory to her [is] victory to these people.' This collection of writings and speeches by and on Nehru shows us the mind--the ideology, born of experience, observation and deep study--behind this democratic and inclusive idea of India. It is a book of particular relevance at a time when 'nationalism' and the slogan 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' are being used to construct a militant and purely emotional idea of India that excludes millions of residents and citizens. 'Who Is Bharat Mata?' contains selections from Nehru's classic books--An Autobiography, Glimpses of World History and The Discovery of India; his speeches, essays and letters from the pre- and post-Independence years; and some of his most revealing interviews. The concluding section of the book comprises reminiscences and assessments of Nehru by his contemporaries--among them, Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Aruna Asaf Ali, Sheikh Abdullah, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Ali Sardar Jafri, Martin Luther King Jr and Atal Bihar Vajpayee. In this carefully put-together anthology--which also carries an illuminating introduction--Nehru emerges as a remarkable man of ideas and action who had an instinctive understanding of India's civilizational spirit, as also a clear commitment to the scientific temper; and as a leader who, despite the compulsions of politics, remained a true democrat. His legacy continues to be extremely relevant--for, in the words of the editor, an understanding of 'Nehru's political and intellectual journey is a pre-condition for India's survival as a democratic polity and as a humane, compassionate society'.",
